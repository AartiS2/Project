This repository consists of files required to deploy a **Web App** created with **Web Apps on Microsoft Azure**.# Brain is the regulatory unit in human body. It controls the functions such as memory, vision, hearing, knowledge, personality, problem solving, etc. The main reason for brain tumour is the abandoned progress of brain cells. Many health organizations have recognized brain tumour as the second foremost dispute that causes a large number of human deaths all around the world. Identification of brain tumour at a premature stage offers a opportunity of effective medical treatment. Use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging images have been recognized as more detailed and more consistent images when compared to Computed Tomography images. There are various techniques to detect brain tumour or neoplasms. The most competent and effective algorithms are discussed in this paper after studying a number of appropriate research papers. Pre-processing brain images, segmenting them, feature extraction, clustering and detection of the tumour are the methodologies in most researches.

### Problem Statement/Oppurtunity:

Automated defect detection in medical imaging has become the emergent field in several
medical diagnostic applications. Automated detection of tumor in MRI is very crucial as it
provides information about abnormal tissues which is necessary for planning treatment. The
conventional method for defect detection in magnetic resonance brain images is human
inspection. This method is impractical due to large amount of data. Hence, trusted and automatic
classification schemes are essential to prevent the death rate of human. So, automated tumor
detection methods are developed as it would save radiologist time and obtain a tested accuracy.
The MRI brain tumor detection is complicated task due to complexity and variance of tumors. In
this project, we propose the machine learning algorithms to overcome the drawbacks of
traditional classifiers where tumor is detected in brain MRI using machine learning algorithms.
Machine learning and image classifier can be used to efficiently detect cancer cells in brain
through MRI.

## PROJECT DISCRIPTION:

### INTRODUCTION:

Tumor biopsy being challenging for brain tumor patients, non-invasive imaging
techniques like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) have been extensively employed in
diagnosing brain tumors. Therefore, development of systems for the detection and prediction of
the grade of tumors based on MRI data has become necessary. But at first sight of the imaging
modality like in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), the proper visualisation of the tumor cells
and its differentiation with its nearby soft tissues is somewhat difficult task which may be due to
the presence of low illumination in imaging modalities or its large presence of data or several
complexity and variance of tumors-like unstructured shape, viable size and unpredictable
locations of the tumor.
Automated defect detection in medical imaging using machine learning has become the
emergent field in several medical diagnostic applications. Its application in the detection of brain
tumor in MRI is very crucial as it provides information about abnormal tissues which is
necessary for planning treatment.Studies in the recent literature have also reported that automatic
computerized detection and diagnosis of the disease, based on medical image analysis, could be
a good alternative as it would save radiologist time and also obtain a tested accuracy.
Furthermore, if computer algorithms can provide robust and quantitative measurements of tumor
depiction, these automated measurements will greatly aid in the clinical management of brain
tumors by freeing physicians from the burden of the manual depiction of tumors.

## Conclusion:

Without pre-trained Keras model, the train accuracy is 97.5% and validation accuracy is
90.0%.The validation result had a best figure of 91.09% as accuracy.It is observed that without
using pre-trained Keras model, although the training accuracy is >90%, the overall accuracy is
low unlike where pre-trained model is used.
Also, when we trained our dataset without Transfer learning, the computation time was
40 min whereas when we used Transfer Learning, the computation time was 20min. Hence,
training and computation time with pre-trained Keras model was 50% lesser than without.
Chances over over-fitting the dataset is higher when training the model from scratch
rather than using pre-trained Keras.Keras also provides an easy interface for data augmentation
